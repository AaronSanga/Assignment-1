NOTE: When I first started the assignment I was accidentally working in a different repository, the one I used to take notes during lectures, and had to create this new one so that I can deploy my website. Therefore any updates and changes I commited during the process of my website have not been recorded here. I still believe my first few commits can be found in the first repository I was working in and I can still provide it if necessary.
